        - Vectors are sequence containers representing arrays that can change size

        - Unlike arrays, the internal arrays of vectors can change dynamically by reallocating memory to adjust for size differences
        - Compared to arrays, vectors consume more memory
        - Vectors are efficient at accessing elements, and efficient at adding or removing elements at the end
        - Vectors are not as efficient when inserting elements or when removing element that are not at the end
