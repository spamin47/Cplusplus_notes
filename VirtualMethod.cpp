/*

- interface: has all PURE virtual methods
- How to know if there is a pure virtual method?
    - method is = to 0
    - In the header file of the class, we can check for inheritance
    - can compile the program to know right away (brute force/quicker way)

VIRTUAL METHODS
- virtual methods are different from PURE virtual methods
- This kind of virtual method is implemented at the base class
  level where as in an abstract class/interface, there is NO
  implementation of a pure virtual method in its base class
    - With it, we have a choice of reimplementing the method or
      keep the virtual method implementation
