Mutexes
- A lock or mutex (from mutual exclusion) is a synchronization mechanism for enforcing limits on access to a resource
in an environment where there are many threads of execution.

- A lock is designed to enforce a mutual exclusion concurrency control policy.
- This is the basic structure of synchronization.
- It models Mutuals Exclusive access to shared data between multiple threads, by using a memory barrier.

Syntax
- Header | #include <mutex>
- Declaration | std::mutex mutex_name;
- to acquire the mutex | mutex_name.lock();
- to release the mutex | mutex_name.unlock();
